<h1>TL;DR ‚å®Ô∏è</h1> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Repo%20Status-Archived-lightgrey.svg">
<p>This project turned out to be an unprecedented phenomenal success! As a member of GitHub Education, I acquired the domain at no cost, which provided a strong foundation to build upon. The support from contributors throughout the journey was truly exceptional and played a significant role in this achievement.
</p>
<p>
The domain's SEO ranking skyrocketed üöÄ, far exceeding expectations, making it a valuable asset for the community. Although I had planned to renew the domain for another year to continue its use, but the domain price went up 173X times the original ü•∂

| ‚ö° [`*.is-a.co`](https://is-a.co/) | ![cf][badge-cf] ![dnssec][badge-dnssec] ![ssl][badge-ssl] |

> Wildcards (like `*.foo.is-a.co`) are supported too

## Why?

First of all, I want to answer one important question - "Why are you giving out domains for free?". Because sometimes I need domains for my pet projects, and instead of buying new domains every time, I decided to buy one for everyone, and use subdomains. And why not share them with the community?
